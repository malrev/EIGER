# EIGER

This repository contains sample IOCs generated by EIGER, the automated IOC generation system. The IOCs are:

- Composed of file paths, registry keys, and process arguments created by the malware collected in May 2020.
- Written in accordance with OpenIOC v1.1.
- Provided on a no-warranty basis.

Note that the presence of artifacts matching these IOCs on your device does not necessarily mean that the device is infected.
